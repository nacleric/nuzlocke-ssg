## Nuzlocke-SSG
A Static site generator for nuzlocke challenges

## TODO:
#### [Important]
- Make templates nicer (in progress)
- Create a function that deletes Posts before build

#### [Not Important]
- Might add support for M/F sprites (probably not, this might require separating folders)

#### [Recently Finished]
- Copy sprite assets to build folder (Finished I think)
    -Ideas: revamp sprite_dl. Instead of download to content folder download directly to build
    folder. Or giv the option to target of specific folder in the configs
- img url should be included into PokemonData

#### [Possible variable name changes]
- When reading files changes "as f" to file
- change generate to build in functions
- Change index.html to just index.html [cant search and replace]
- change pokemon_list.html -> pokemon_list.html [cant search and replace]

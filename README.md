## Nuzlocke-SSG
A Static site generator for nuzlocke challenges

## TODO:
#### [Important]
- Make templates nicer (in progress)
- Change home.html to just index.html
- img url should be included into PokemonData
- Create a function that deletes Posts before build


#### [Not Important]
- Might add support for M/F sprites

#### [Finished]
- Copy sprite assets to build folder (finished i think)
    -Ideas: revamp sprite_dl. Instead of download to content folder download directly to build
    folder. Or giv the option to target of specific folder in the configs

#### Possible variable name changes
When reading files changes "as f" to file
change generate to build in functions
